Jinja syntax and file type detection for Vim
############################################

This plugin adds support  for the Jinja_ template engine to  Vim the Right Way™
by making  use of Vim's dotted  filetype syntax. This makes  the plugin smaller
and simpler to maintain, while at the  same time being more flexible by letting
Vim combine support for any host language (such as HTML) rather than pulling it
in through some hacky means.

There are a number  of Jinja plugins out there, including  an official one, but
they all force the file type to `jinja`  and then pull in the HTML settings. By
making use of the dotted file type syntax  we are not limited to HTML alone, we
can support  any other host file  type as well at  no extra cost. To  quote the
Jinja documentation:

   A Jinja  template is simply a  text file. Jinja can  generate any text-based
   format (HTML, XML, CSV, LaTeX, etc.).  A Jinja template doesn’t need to have
   a specific extension: `.html`, `.xml`, or any other extension is just fine.

.. _Jinja: http://jinja.pocoo.org/

Jinja.vim even  goes the  extra mile  and recognises file  names with  two file
types like `foo.html.jinja`  correctly as `html.jinja`. At the same  time it is
clever  enough to  know that  `foo.deprecated.jinja` is  of type  `jinja` alone
since `deprecated` is not a file type Vim knows about (unless you have a plugin
that would support  such a type of  course). This works recursively,  so if the
first file type could be a compound as well Vim will take care of it.


Installation
============

Use your preferred  method of installing Vim plugins,  manually or  via package
manager. There is nothing out of the ordinary here.

The plugin repository does define some Git submodules, but they are only needed
if you want to run tests.  They are not needed to run the plugin, if you do not
intend to run the tests they will just waste space.


Configuration
=============

Since this is just a  syntax and filetype-detection plugin  there is nothing to
configure,  once  a  file  has  been  identified  as a  Jinja file  it will  be
highlighted  appropriately.  Any  file  with  the  extension  `.jinja`  will be
recognised as a Jinja file.

On the other hand,  if you want to use  Jinja highlighting in  other file types
like HTML you will  have to set it up appropriately.  For HTML support  add the
following line  to your `ftdetect/html.vim` file  inside the `~/.vim/` (Vim) or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/` (Neovim) directory:

.. code-block:: vim

   autocmd! BufRead,BufNewFile *.html  call jinja#AdjustFiletype()

The function `AdjustFiletype` is explained below.


The `AdjustFiletype` funtion
----------------------------

`AdjustFiletype` is  a function provided by  the plugin as a  convenient way of
detecting the presence of Jinja code in  a buffer and changing the file type if
necessary by appending `.jinja` to it.


Note regarding Neovim and Tree-sitter
=====================================

If Neovim's Tree-sitter syntax highlighting is active regular syntax
highlighting will be disabled.  This means for example that if you edit a
`html.jinja` file and you have the Tree-sitter HTML parser installed the
regular highlighting for Jinja will be disabled.  If you want to have both
Tree-sitter highlighting for HTML and regular highlighting for Jinja in your
buffer you need to set `syntax=on` for that buffer.

One way of automating this is to add this snippet to `ftplugin/jinja.vim`:

.. code:: vim

   if !get(b:, 'jinja_syntax_autocmd_loaded', v:false)
	   if luaeval("vim.treesitter.language.get_lang('jinja')") == v:null
		   autocmd FileType <buffer> if !empty(&ft) | setlocal syntax=on | endif
	   endif
	   let b:jinja_syntax_autocmd_loaded = v:true
   endif



Bugs and Caveats
================

Even though the dotted file type notation  is the Right Way not all Vim plugins
are respecting  it. If that is  the case please  bring the issue to  the plugin
authors' attention; fixing  the issue once in that plugin  will forever benefit
everyone while applying a  hack to my plugin is just  shoving the problem under
the rug for the time being.

Jinja.vim will recognise the file  `foo.html.jinja` as of `html.jinja` type and
`foo.deprecated.jinja`  or `foo.jinja`  as just  `jinja`, but  if you  were the
change the file  name from the former to  one of the latter the  plugin will be
unable to pick up  that change. This only happens when the  target file type is
plain `jinja`. Changing `foo.html.jinja` to  `foo.xml.jinja` will work fine. To
my knowledge there is no way of fixing this without changing Vim.
